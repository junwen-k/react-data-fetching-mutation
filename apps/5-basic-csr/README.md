## Overview

This app demonstrates the most basic form of client-side data fetching and mutation in React, using `fetch` and `useState` without any external libraries. It shows how to manually manage API calls and pagination, using custom hooks (`useGetPosts`, `useCreatePost`, `useDeletePost`) and implementing pagination with `@tanstack/react-table`. The focus is on building these features from scratch to understand the underlying process, instead of relying on higher-level abstractions.
