## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use `react-query` and `ky` to handle data fetching and mutation in a client-side rendered (CSR) application. It simplifies the process of interacting with an API by using react-query's hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` for fetching, creating, and deleting posts. The implementation leverages automatic caching, pagination, and optimistic updates, making it more efficient than manual data management. This example also showcases how to integrate these hooks with `@tanstack/react-table` to manage pagination and display the data in a table.
