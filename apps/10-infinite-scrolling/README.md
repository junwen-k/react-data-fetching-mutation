## Overview

This app uses React Query for data fetching and mutations, with support for both server actions and direct API calls. It organizes logic into `apis`, `actions`, and `queries` folders, where data fetching and mutations are managed through React Query hooks for efficient state management and caching. Server-side or client-side calls are handled seamlessly, ensuring up-to-date data across the app.
