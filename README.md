### *Talk Title*: Mastering Data Fetching and Mutations in React: A Practical Guide

1. *Introduction*
   - Brief self-introduction and overview of the talk.
   - *Key Point*: Introduce data fetching and mutation handling in React.

2. *Basic Data Fetching (CSR)*
   - Using fetch with useEffect and useState to manually handle loading, error, and data.
   - *Key Point*: Highlight the downsides of manual management, such as:
     - No built-in caching mechanism
     - Verbose code requiring manual loading and error state handling.

3. *Popular API Clients*
   - Overview of popular API clients like Axios, Ky, and Wretch.
   - *Key Point*: Discuss how these libraries simplify making HTTP requests by providing:
     - Cleaner syntax
     - Built-in support for JSON, automatic request cancellation, and retries.

4. *Managed Data Fetching with Libraries*
   - Introduction to libraries like react-query, SWR, and Apollo Client.
   - *Key Point*: Simplifying data fetching, caching, and state management with minimal boilerplate.
   - *Comparison*: Manual fetch vs. react-query:
     - Highlight benefits like automatic caching, deduplication, and UI updates.

5. *Mutations and Query Invalidation*
   - Using useMutation to handle data updates and the importance of query invalidation.
   - *Key Point*: Automatic UI sync after mutations by refetching data.
   - *Methods*: 
     - invalidateQueries (preferred) for automatic updates.
     - Manual cache update for specific use cases.

6. *Server-Side Basic Data Fetching (SSR) with Next.js*
   - Using fetch in server-side components and passing data to the client.
   - Invalidate with revalidatePath / revalidateTag in server action.
   - *Key Point*: Basic fetching patterns work well, but limitations arise with more complex needs, such as:
     - Polling with interval refetching.
     - Infinite queries that require more sophisticated handling.

7. *Server-Side Managed Data Fetching with Libraries (SSR) with Next.js*
   - Using react-query for SSR with data prefetching, hydration, and query caching.
   - *Key Point*: Importance of prefetching for SSR to ensure data is available immediately.
   - *Methods*: 
     - initialData to provide initial state for the client.
     - Hydration API to rehydrate query state on the client side.

8. *Mutations and Query Invalidation (SSR)*
   - Using useMutation with server actions for SSR.
   - *Key Point*: Query invalidation must occur on the client side; it doesn't work when we attempt to invalidate queries within server action.

9. *Advanced Techniques*
   - *Optimistic Updates*: When to use optimistic UI updates for instant feedback.
     - *Key Point*: Use cautiously to avoid added complexity and potential bugs.
   - *Infinite Queries*: Implementing infinite scroll with useInfiniteQuery.
     - *Key Point*: Efficiently handling pagination and loading states to improve user experience.

10. *Conclusion*
    - Recap key takeaways: Client-side vs. server-side data fetching, managing mutations, and advanced techniques like optimistic updates and infinite scroll.
    - *Key Point*: When to effectively use libraries like react-query in modern React applications, emphasizing the trade-offs and appropriate use cases.
